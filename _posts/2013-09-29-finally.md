I finally got round to converting the Github Pages Merlot theme into a Jekyll theme, and so I have
finally commenced my blog! The idea behind this blog is for it to be a place where I can share
useful bits of python, emacs, Fortran, etc. that I have picked up; and moreover, a place where I can
dump all those useful bits so I can find them later! I also intend to write some posts about my work
and the various half-finished github projects I've started (case in point: this Jekyll theme).

I'm going to attempt to force myself to update this site pretty often, which means just getting on
and writing posts and publishing them, so I imagine the first few will be fairly scrappy.

First up, how I created this site...
